        "**Cross-entropy** is a loss function we can use to train a model when the output is one of several classes. For example, we have 10 classes to choose from when trying to predict which number an image of a single digit represents.\n",

The cross-entropy loss then enables us to train the model such that the value of the output corresponding to the correct prediction is high, and for the other outputs it is low.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first step of using the cross-entropy loss function is passing the raw outputs of the model through a **softmax layer**. A softmax layer squishes all the outputs of the model between 0 and 1. It also ensures that all these values combined add up to 1.\n",
