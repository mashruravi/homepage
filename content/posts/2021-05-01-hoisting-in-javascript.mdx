title: Hoisting in JavaScript

On a high level, JavaScript code goes through two phases: **compilation** and **execution**. I say "on a high level" because there will actually be some more things going on under the hood. See [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51447411/5774633) on StackOverflow for a quick overview of what else happens in Chrome's V8 engine.

Hoisting happens during the **compilation** phase. Function declarations and variables defined using the `var` keyword are moved to the top of their scope.[^1] This allows for weird things to happen like calling a function before it is defined.

### Hoisting of functions

Doing this in Python would give you an error:

```python
# hello.py

say_hello()

def say_hello():
  print("Hello!")
```

```shell
$ python3 hello.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "hello.py", line 1, in <module>
    say_hello()
NameError: name 'say_hello' is not defined
```

But, it works perfectly fine in JavaScript!

```javascript
// hello.js

sayHello();

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```

```shell
$ node hello.js
Hello!
```

This is because the function is hoisted to the top of its scope. i.e. when execution of `hello.js` begins, the definition of `sayHello` is put into memory during the **compilation** phase.

**Function expressions**, however, are not hoisted.

```javascript
// hello2.js

sayHello();

var sayHello = function() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```

```shell
$ node hello2.js

sayHello();
^

TypeError: sayHello is not a function
  ...
  ...
  ...
```

### Hoisting of multiple functions with same name

If there are multiple functions with the same name, they are hoisted in the order they are defined.

```javascript
// multifunc.js

function foo() {
  console.log("bar");
}

foo();

function foo() {
  console.log("baz");
}
```

```shell
$ node multifunc.js 
baz
```

During the **compilation** phase, the first `foo` is loaded into memory. Then, the second one is loaded which overwrites the first one. Therefore, when `foo()` is called during the execution phase, the second function is executed.

### Hoisting of variables

Variables declared using the `var` keyword are hoisted to the top of the scope. However, only the declarations are hoisted and if there are any initializations, they remain exactly where they are.

```javascript
// foobar.js

console.log(foo);
var foo = "bar";
console.log(foo);
```

```shell
$ node foobar.js 
undefined
bar
```

Since only the declaration of the variable `foo` is hoisted, the first `console.log` statement logs `undefined`.

Then, the variable is assigned the value "bar" which the next `console.log` statement logs.

### Hoisting of variable and function with the same name

If there is a variable declared using the `var` keyword and a function definition with the same name in a scope, **only the function is hoisted**.

```javascript
// varfunc.js

console.log(foo);

function foo() {
  console.log("baz");
}

var foo = "bar";
```

```shell
$ node varfunc.js
[Function: foo]
```

[^1]: As described in the [MDN glossary entry for Hoisting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting), variables and functions being hoisted are not physically moved. They stay exactly where they are typed in the source code; their definitions are put into memory during the compilation phase.
