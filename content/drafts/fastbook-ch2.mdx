## First, some advice...

> Underestimating the constraints and overestimating the capabilities of deep learning may lead to frustratingly poor results. Conversely, overestimating the constraints and underestimating the capabilities of deep learning may mean you do not attempt a solvable problem because you talk yourself out of it.

When starting your deep learning journey, don't try to look for the perfect dataset of the perfect project. Start with a small project that is exciting to you and keep iterating, learning and improving!

> ...if you take this approach, you will be on your third iteration of learning and improving while the perfectionists are still in the planning stages!

Also, when iterating, ensure that you are spending enough time on all stages of the project - starting from data collection to training your model all the way to deploying your model.

> By completing the project end to end, you will see where the trickiest bits are, and which bits make the biggest difference to the final result.


## Humans and Machines

Deep learning models are capable of doing some truly amazing things. From classifying images and text, to generating images from captions and vice versa. However, although results of deep learning models might be context-appropriate, there is no guarantee that they may be correct. Take a look at what [this](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/#sample8) deep learning model has to say about recycling if you don't believe me!

The best way to leverage deep learning is by making it a part of a process in which a human user can interact with it closely. This greatly increases the productivity of human beings, and also eliminates the risk associated with a deep learning model operating on its own in the wild.


## The Drivetrain Approach

> Many accurate models are of no use to anyone, and many inaccurate models are highly useful.

1. Consider what your objective is
2. Think about what actions you can take to meet that objective (levers)
3. Think about what data you have, or can acquire, that can help
4. Build a model to determine the best action to take to obtain the best results to meet your objective

The goal of the Drivetrain Approach is the produce "actionable outcomes" instead of just predictions.

## Using Biased Data to Train Models

A model is only as good as the data used to train it. The world is full of biased data so we need to be careful not to let this bias creep in when we are creating our dataset.

> Be sure to think carefully about the types of data that you might expect to see in practice in your application, and check carefully to ensure that all these types are reflected in your model's source data.

## Fastai Jargon

- DataLoaders
- DataBlock (ImageBlock, CategoryBlock)

A DataBlock provides a template to create an instance of a DataLoaders object.

DataLoaders is a thin class that stores instances of DataLoader passed to it.
